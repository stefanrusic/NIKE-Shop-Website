    <h2> This is a List of Nike, Inc. sponsorships.</h2>
    <p >Nike pays top athletes in many sports to use their products and promote and advertise their
        technology and design.
    </p><br>
    <p>Nike's first professional athlete endorser was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilie_N%C4%83stase"  target="_blank"> Romanian tennis player Ilie Năstase</a>. The first track
        endorser was
        distance runner Steve Prefontaine. Prefontaine was the prized pupil of the company's co-founder, Bill Bowerman,
        while he coached
        at the University of Oregon. Today, the Steve Prefontaine Building is named in his honor at Nike's corporate
        headquarters.
    </p><br>
    <p> Nike has also sponsored many other successful track and field athletes over the years, such as
        Carl Lewis,
        Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Sebastian Coe.  The signing of basketball player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a> in 1984, with his
        subsequent promotion
        of Nike over the course of his career, with Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon, proved to be one of the biggest boosts
        to Nike's publicity and sales.
    </p><br>
    <p>Nike is a major sponsor of the athletic programs at Penn State University and named its first child
        care facility
        after Joe Paterno when it opened in 1990 at the company's headquarters. Nike originally announced it would not
        remove Paterno's
        name from the building in the wake of the Penn State sex abuse scandal. After the Freeh Report was released on
        July 12, 2012, Nike
        CEO Mark Parker announced the name Joe Paterno would be removed immediately from the child development center. A
        new name has yet to
        be announced.
    </p><br>
    <p>Nike also sponsored soccer players such as Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Cristiano Ronaldo, Didier Drogba,
        Neymar, Zlatan
        Ibrahimović, Wesley Sneijder, Wayne Rooney and Landon Donovan, among others.
    </p><br>
    <p>In January 2013, Nike signed Rory McIlroy, the then-number one golfer in the world, to a ten-year
        sponsorship
        deal worth $250 million. The deal includes using Nike's range of golf clubs, a move Nick Faldo previously
        described as "dangerous"
        for McIlroy's game.
    </p> <br>
    <p>On February 21, 2013, Nike announced it suspended its contract with Oscar Pistorius, due to his
        being charged with premeditated murder.
